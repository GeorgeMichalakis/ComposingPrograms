"""
Recursive if the body of the function calls the function itself either dirextly or indirectly.

When a recursive procedure is divided among two functions that call each other, the functions are said to be mutually recursive.

Another common pattern of computation is called tree recursion, in which a function calls itself more than once. As an example, consider computing the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, in which each number is the sum of the preceding two.
